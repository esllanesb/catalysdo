                <p>
                  If using a collection in a High Availability configuration, it is recommended to specify an explicit
                  collection name through this property when then collection's directory name is long (for example if
                  it is an absolute path). This is because collection names are exchanged between cluster nodes for
                  the purpose of data replication and synchronization.

                <p>
                  Standard capacity lists provide excellent read and write performance and contain about 12 bytes of
                  overhead for each element. Initialization time can be affected when the list grows large since, in
                  order to maintain excellent write performance there are no disk indices, which means they must be
                  deduced on initialization. Standard capacity lists also have the additional specific properties
                  specified in
                  <a href="apds02.html#persistent_collections_properties-listCollectionProperties" title="D.2.2.1.&nbsp;Standard Capacity Collection Properties">Standard Capacity List Properties</a>.
                </p>

                <p>
                  High capacity lists preserve low start times. They have slightly worse read and write performance
                  than standard capacity lists and they have fixed, configurable memory overhead (the default is 1MB).
                  High capacity lists also have the additional specific properties specified in
                  <a href="apds02.html#persistent_collections_properties-highCapacityListCollectionProperties" title="D.2.2.2.&nbsp;High Capacity List (Indexed) Collection Properties">High Capacity List Properties</a>.
                  In addition to the journal files written for high capacity collections, there is also an index file
                  in the collection directory.

                <p>
                  In HA configurations, if this property is set to <code class="code">true</code> and there is a failed replication
                  attempt, then the outstanding write operations are synchronized with the underlying file.
                </p>

                <p>
                  In standalone configurations, each successful write is synchronized with the underlying file. This
                  can incur a significant performance overhead.
                </p>

                Whether to use write buffering.

                <p>
                  If this property is set to <code class="code">true</code> then data is only flushed to disk when there is
                  <code class="code">writeBufferSize</code> data to write, or the <code class="code">writeBufferFlushingDelay</code> is exceeded.
                  Setting the <code class="code">writeBufferSize</code> to the disk block size increases performance but adds risk
                  that data will be lost on an application restart.
                </p>

                The size, in bytes, of the write buffer to use if write buffering is turned on.

                <p>
                  Note: When a write request larger than this buffer size is encountered, the write buffer is extended
                  so that it can accommodate this write request. However, this is a costly operation, therefore it is
                  recommended to use a sensible size from the beginning rather than relying on this buffer extension
                  mechanism.
                </p>

                <p>Optional. Defaults to 64kB.</p>

                The maximum amount of time, in milliseconds, that data should remain in the writing buffer if write
                buffering is turned on.

                <p>
                  Note: Since this implementation does not use a flushing thread, there is no guarantee that a flush
                  will happen at regular time interval, since writes may be infrequent. Therefore, this delay really
                  comes into play when writes are frequent but the writing buffer takes a long time to fill up.
                </p>

                <p>Optional. Defaults to 1s. Can be between 0.5s and 5s.</p>

                <p>
                  This is an advanced property which should be changed with care. The default should be suitable in a
                  majority of situations. In particular, using large values can cause serious performance degradation.
                </p>

                <p>Optional. Defaults to 128 KB. Value must be between 1 KB and 128 MB.</p>

                The size, in bytes, of the read buffer to use when scanning the underlying journal, either at start-up,
                or after compacting.

                <p>
                  This property has a relatively low default value in order to avoid consuming too much heap memory for
                  collections that are not likely to take a long time to be scanned. For very large collections though,
                  using a large value is likely to have noticeable effects on scanning performance, since fewer I/O
                  operations will be required to go though the entire journal.
                </p>

                <p>Optional. Defaults to 128 KB. Value must be between 1 KB and 128 MB.</p>
              </td></tr><tr><td><a name="persistent_collections_properties-rollJournalFileEvery"></a>rollJournalFileEvery</td><td>
                The maximum size, in bytes, that the current journal file is allowed to reach.

                <p>
                  Once the current journal file reaches that size, a new journal file is created and subsequent
                  writes are made to this new file. Rolling always happens before the limit is reached, which means
                  that journal files can never exceed the limit. A value less than zero disables this rolling
                  functionality, meaning that the journal file will keep growing as long as the file-system allows.
                </p>

                <p>Optional. Defaults to 2GB.</p>
              </td></tr><tr><td><a name="persistent_collections_properties-recordVersionHistory"></a>recordVersionHistory</td><td>
                Whether or not the store's indexer should keep an in-memory record of the offsets of the last write
                requests in the journal in order to be able to access version history.

                <p>
                  When turned on, the actual size of the history is given by the value of property
                  <code class="code">versionHistorySize</code>. This feature is normally only needed when running in High
                  Availability configurations, where it is necessary to be able to replay version history for
                  synchronization purposes. The memory footprint when this feature is turned on is 8 bytes times the
                  size of the history. So for a default history size of 10,000, the footprint is 80 kb.
                </p>

                <p>Optional. Defaults to <code class="code">false</code>.</p>
              </td></tr><tr><td><a name="persistent_collections_properties-versionHistorySize"></a>versionHistorySize</td><td>
                The size of the in-memory record of write request offsets maintained by the store's indexer when
                version history recording is turned on.

                <p>
                  Using a smaller value reduces the memory footprint and start-up time (because it reduces the
                  area in the journal file that must be scanned to reconstruct the history), but increases the
                  likelihood that the entire journal file must be scanned to service a version history request because
                  the requested version is outside the record. Using a larger value increases the memory footprint and
                  start-up time but reduces the likelihood that the entire journal file must be scanned when searching
                  for a version.
                </p>

                <p>Optional. Defaults to 10,000. Can be between 1,000 and 1,000,000.</p>

                  <p>
                    The backlog contains the index entries that have yet to be written to disk. In most cases (i.e. 
                    when data in write requests is not too large), it takes significantly less time to append a write 
                    request to the end of a journal file than to add an index entry to the on-disk index. Therefore,
                    under a constant load of writes, the indexer's backlog will grow until it reaches this limit. Once 
                    the backlog is full, further writes will be throttled to the speed of the index persister thread. 
                    Using a larger limit can be useful if it is necessary to absorb data bursts without performance

                  With caching enabled the underlying implementation maintains an in memory cache for the purpose of 
                  improving read performance. Even though the read performance of the underlying persistent store is 
                  likely to be very good, there is still a cost associated with deserializing data. This cost may be 
                  avoided altogether in many cases via an adequate caching policy.

                  Whether the store's underlying journal should make use of a cache to increase reading performance.
                  
                  <p>
                    When enabled, the store's underlying journal caches bytes in memory to avoid having to read bytes
                    from disk too often. This is a different type of cache to the cache that gets created when using
                    property <code class="code">isCachingEnabled</code>, which caches objects representing map values on the heap
                    and is therefore somewhat limited in size. A journal's bytes cache, by contrast, only caches bytes, 
                    and makes use of off-heap memory to do so, which means that it is only limited by the amount of
                    physical memory available on the local machine. This type of cache is particularly well suited
                    for collections storing large to very large values and from which reads are very frequent. In such 
                    cases, if sized properly, the cache can potentially eliminate the need for disk I/O.
                  </p>

                  <p>Optional. Defaults to <code class="code">false</code>, meaning that the journal does not cache bytes by 
                        default.
                  </p>
                  
                  <p>
                    A journal's bytes cache combines a small synchronous on-heap L1 cache with a very large asynchronous
                    off-heap L2 cache. It therefore requires a dedicated thread to exchange data with its L2 cache.
                    The total capacity of the bytes cache is expressed as a number of bytes (for example, 1 GB), and the
                    amount of heap memory used by the L1 cache never exceeds 5% of that capacity. 
                  </p>
                  
                  <p>
                    The bytes cache uses an LRU (Least Recently Used) policy to evict old entries once at capacity.  
                  </p>
                  
                  <p>
                    In order to get the best out of the amount of off-heap memory that it can use, the L2 cache needs to
                    be calibrated, which is a one-off operation which consists in segmenting the off-heap memory into
                    small data chunks used to store actual payload. The quantity and size of those chunks depends on the 
                    expected size of the payload, which therefore needs to be configured. This is expressed as the cache's
                    average payload size, which is the average size in bytes (for example, 1 KB) of the 
                    <span class="emphasis"><em>values</em></span> stored into the persistent collection. This average payload size does not need
                    to be (and sometimes cannot be) too precise, but it is still important to configure a size that is close 
                    enough to the actual payload size:

                        If the actual payload size is significantly smaller than the configured size, the cache will deliver
                        optimal performance but will not be using all of the off-heap memory that is allocated to it.
                      </li><li class="listitem">
                        If the actual payload size is significantly larger than the configured size, the cache will make use

                      </li></ul></div><p>  
                    In order to ease the configuration of the cache's average payload size, it is possible to get the cache
                    to register a JMX MXBean that exposes various sizing and utilisation attributes that can be used to 
                    detect a suboptimal configuration.

                    The calibration of the journal's bytes cache can take up to a few seconds when done for the first
                    time. For that purpose, the cache persists its calibration data into a directory called
                    <code class="code">calibration</code> located within the persistent collection's directory. This calibration data
                    is reused when present. If the calibration directory gets deleted, then a new calibration will take
                    place the next time the collection is loaded.

                    This is the cache's total capacity, which is split between an on-heap L1 cache which takes up to

                    This size corresponds to the size of <span class="emphasis"><em>values</em></span> stored in the persistent collection. In
                    the case of a persisted map, the key size does not count, the cache is only used to store value bytes.

                  <p>Mandatory when <code class="code">isBytesCachingEnabled</code> is true, ignored otherwise. Value must be at least 
                        64 bytes and should ideally be as close as possible to the actual average payload size. Significant
                        differences between the configured value and the actual average payload size will not cause the
                        cache to malfunction, but it may not make the best out of its off-heap memory (in cases where the
                        actual payload size is much larger than the configured value) or it won't deliver optimal reading
                        performance (in cases where the actual payload size is much smaller than the configured value).
                        It is therefore recommended to use the JMX MXBean that the cache can optionally expose to determine
                        whether this value is properly configured.
