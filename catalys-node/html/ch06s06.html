      Secure Sockets Layer (SSL) and its successor Transport Layer Security (TLS) allow secure, authenticated
      connections to be made across an insecure network, such as the Internet. SSL and TLS are well-established standard
      protocols that are widely supported. You can connect to another party, who may be using a FIX engine from a
      different supplier, with high confidence that the two FIX engines will communicate without difficulty.
    </p><p>
      SSL/TLS encrypts the whole of the data traffic between the FIX engines, including the protocol and addressing
      fields, unlike FIX encryption which encrypts only the application data. This makes SSL/TLS unsuitable for systems
      where an intermediate FIX engine is required to route FIX messages without decrypting them.
    </p><p>
      In all other situations, SSL/TLS provides the simplest and easiest way of ensuring the security and
      confidentiality of your FIX messages.
    </p></div><div class="section"><div class="titlepage"><div><div><h3 class="title"><a name="d5e5072"></a>6.6.2.&nbsp;Java Keystores and Truststores</h3></div></div></div><p>
      The Node uses the standard
      <a href="http://docs.oracle.com/javase/7/docs/technotes/guides/security/jsse/JSSERefGuide.html" target="_top">Java JSSE</a>
      (Java Secure Sockets Extension) to provide secure connections between FIX parties. To accept SSL connections
      on a FIX session, the Node must be configured with a <span class="emphasis"><em>keystore</em></span>; to initiate an SSL
      connection with another FIX server, the Node must be configured with a <span class="emphasis"><em>truststore</em></span>.
    </p><p>
      A keystore contains one or more private keys, whereas a truststore contains the public key certificates of
      those organizations that the user is prepared to trust. JSSE will not permit a client connection to an SSL server
      unless the certificate presented by the server has been installed in the truststore.
    </p><p>
      There is no difference in the file format of the keystore and the truststore, and in fact one file can serve as
      both, though for practical reasons this is not generally recommended. The main reason for this is that the
      entities you trust are likely to be the same for all of your applications, but the key you use is likely to be
      different per application.
    </p><p>
      In most cases, you will need to create and manage your own stores.  This is most easily done using the
      <a class="code" href="http://docs.oracle.com/javase/7/docs/technotes/tools/index.html#security" target="_top">keytool</a>
      command-line utility bundled with the Oracle JRE. However, if your counterparty uses a commercial
      certificate authority to sign its certificates, you may be able to use the default truststore,
      <span class="emphasis"><em>cacerts</em></span>, that is bundled with the JRE and includes details for several well-known
      certificate authorities. This file is found in <span class="emphasis"><em>JAVA_HOME/jre/lib/security</em></span>.
    </p><p>
	  We support usage of standard keystore(PKCS12). PKCS12 keystore file must have the extension ".p12" 
	  for it to be recognized as a PKCS12 format file. Truststore, however, cannot be PKCS12 because 
	  truststore cannot contain private keys. PKCS12 format is a container for a keypair (private + public key).
     </p></div><div class="section"><div class="titlepage"><div><div><h3 class="title"><a name="d5e5085"></a>6.6.3.&nbsp;SSL Protocols</h3></div></div></div><p>
      JSSE supports a number of SSL/TLS protocols including TLSv1, TLSv1.1, TLSv1.2, SSLv2Hello and SSLv3.
    </p><div class="warning"><h3 class="title">Warning</h3><p>
        Due to security vulnerabilities in SSLv3, it is recommended that this protocol not be used.
      </p></div><p>
      In all newer releases of Oracle's JRE,
      <a href="https://www.java.com/en/download/help/disable_sslv3.xml" target="_top">SSLv3 is disabled by default</a>.
      If you're running an older release, SSLv3 should be explicitly disabled via the <code class="code">enabledProtocols</code>
      attribute of <code class="code">SSLSocketConnection</code>.  We recommend setting the value of this attribute to
      <code class="code">TLSv1 TLSv1.1 TLSv1.2</code>, assuming your counterparty supports one of these.
    </p><p>
      The TLSv1 specification indicates that an SSLv2 "HELLO" message should initiate the handshake so that
      TLS servers can still talk to v2 servers. Normally the protocol will be negotiated at the highest level of
      security that both parties support. However some parties may have disallowed, or do not support, the old v2
      handshake. In this case you can prevent the Node from sending a v2 HELLO by setting the <code class="code">noSSLv2Hello</code>
      attribute to <code class="code">true</code> on the <code class="code">SSLSocketConnection</code>. Note that if this is a listening server
      socket, this will also disallow clients who try to connect using a v2 HELLO, which in most cases is not desirable.
      Please be sure that you understand the compatibility and security implications before changing this option.
      Except for the initial handshake, SSL v2 should not be used and is not supported by the Node due to widely known
      vulnerabilities.
    </p></div><div class="section"><div class="titlepage"><div><div><h3 class="title"><a name="d5e5099"></a>6.6.4.&nbsp;Configuration</h3></div></div></div><p>
      Configuring the Node for SSL involves two main steps: creating the necessary keystores/truststores, and adding
      the requisite SSL settings to each applicable session in the Node's configuration file.  This process differs
      depending on whether you are <span class="emphasis"><em>accepting</em></span> SSL connections from other parties or you are
      <span class="emphasis"><em>initiating</em></span> SSL connections with a counterparty.
    </p><p>
      A working template that demonstrates the SSL configuration can be found in the
      <span class="emphasis"><em>templates/SSL/</em></span> directory of your Node installation.
    </p><div class="section"><div class="titlepage"><div><div><h4 class="title"><a name="optfeature_ssl-acceptor-config"></a>6.6.4.1.&nbsp;Configuring a Session to Accept SSL Connections</h4></div></div></div><p>
        When accepting SSL connections (you are the SSL server), you must create a keypair and a keystore that contains
        it.  You'll then generate a public key certificate that corresponds to your key; this certificate must be
        distributed to your clients so that they can configure their system to trust your server.
      </p><div class="simplesect"><div class="titlepage"><div><div><h5 class="title"><a name="d5e5109"></a>Creating a Keystore and Keypair</h5></div></div></div><p>
          To create the keypair in a new keystore:
        </p><pre class="programlisting">$ keytool -genkeypair -alias fixSSL -keystore server.keystore
Enter keystore password:  ********
Re-enter new password: ********
What is your first and last name?
  [Unknown]:  FIX
What is the name of your organizational unit?
  [Unknown]:  FIX
What is the name of your organization?
  [Unknown]:  Company
What is the name of your City or Locality?
  [Unknown]:  Chicago
What is the name of your State or Province?
  [Unknown]:  IL
What is the two-letter country code for this unit?
  [Unknown]:  US
Is CN=FIX, OU=FIX, O=Company, L=Chicago, ST=IL, C=US correct?
  [no]:  y

Enter key password for &lt;fixSSL&gt;
	(RETURN if same as keystore password):</pre><p>
          This will generate a new keystore, <span class="emphasis"><em>server.keystore</em></span>, in the current directory. The
          passwords you choose for the store and the key will be used later when configuring the Node to use this file.
        </p><p>
          Now the public key certificate must be exported:
        </p><pre class="programlisting">$ keytool -exportcert -alias fixSSL -keystore server.keystore -file server.cer
Enter keystore password:  ********  (the password chosen in the previous step)
Certificate stored in file &lt;server.cer&gt;</pre><p>
          This will create a PKCS7 file, <span class="emphasis"><em>server.cer</em></span>, which can be distributed to your
          counterparties. The certificate in this file is <span class="emphasis"><em>self-signed</em></span>; if you wish, you can have
          your public key signed by a well-known commercial certificate authority, in which case you would provide your
          counterparty with the certificate(s) created by that CA instead.
        </p><p>
          It is recommended to keep just a single private key and its associated certificate in any keystore. This is
          because JSSE by default selects the first private key that it finds in the keystore. You have no control over
          which private key is selected if there is more than one present.
        </p></div><div class="simplesect"><div class="titlepage"><div><div><h5 class="title"><a name="d5e5121"></a>Configuring the Session</h5></div></div></div><p>
          With the keystore in hand, you can now configure the FIX session to accept SSL connections:
        </p><pre class="programlisting">&lt;Session compid="SERVER"
         counterpartycompid="CLIENT"
         fixversion="4.2"

          Note we are using an <a class="code" href="config_reference.html#config_ref_SSLSocketConnection" title="SSLSocketConnection">SSLSocketConnection</a>
          element instead of the standard <code class="code">SocketConnection</code>. The <code class="code">keyStorePassword</code> and
          <code class="code">keyPassword</code> attributes of the <code class="code">Session</code> must match the passwords you chose when
          creating the keystore and key in the previous step.
        </p></div></div><div class="section"><div class="titlepage"><div><div><h4 class="title"><a name="optfeature_ssl-initiator-config"></a>6.6.4.2.&nbsp;Configuring a Session to Initiate an SSL Connection</h4></div></div></div><p>
        When initiating SSL connections (you are the SSL client), you must create a truststore that contains the
        public key certificate of the server to which you are connecting. Your counterparty should have provided
        this file (or sometimes multiple files).
      </p><div class="simplesect"><div class="titlepage"><div><div><h5 class="title"><a name="d5e5134"></a>Importing the Server's Certificate into a Truststore</h5></div></div></div><p>
          In this example, we'll assume the counterparty we are trusting has provided one certificate,
          <span class="emphasis"><em>server.cer</em></span>. To create a truststore and import this certificate:
        </p><pre class="programlisting">$ keytool -importcert -alias server -file server.cer -keystore client.truststore

Trust this certificate? [no]:  y

          This will generate a new truststore, <span class="emphasis"><em>client.truststore</em></span>, in the current directory.
          The password you chose will be used later when configuring the Node to use this file.
        </p><p>
          The import command asks if you want to trust the imported certificate. In a live SSL environment, you'll
          be connecting to a remote SSL server, possibly one that belongs to another organization. The owner of that
          server will have sent you a certificate, most likely via email. How do you know that it hasn't been tampered
          with while in transit? Every certificate has a <span class="emphasis"><em>fingerprint</em></span>, which <code class="code">keytool</code>
          displays when asking about trust. Before you answer the question, you should contact the person who sent the
          certificate and have them confirm the fingerprint. This should ideally be done over a different communication
          channel than the one used to deliver the certificate. After confirming the fingerprint, you can be sure that
          the certificate has not been interfered with and that it can be safely trusted.
        </p></div><div class="simplesect"><div class="titlepage"><div><div><h5 class="title"><a name="d5e5144"></a>Configuring the Session</h5></div></div></div><p>
          With the truststore in hand, you can now configure the FIX session to use SSL:
        </p><pre class="programlisting">&lt;Session compid="CLIENT"
         counterpartycompid="SERVER"
         fixversion="4.2"

    &lt;ListenerMessageProcessors/&gt;
  &lt;/SessionManager&gt;
&lt;/Session&gt;</pre><p>
          Note we are using an <a class="code" href="config_reference.html#config_ref_SSLSocketConnection" title="SSLSocketConnection">SSLSocketConnection</a>
          element instead of the standard <code class="code">SocketConnection</code>. The <code class="code">trustStorePassword</code> attribute
          of the <code class="code">Session</code> must match the password you chose when creating the truststore in the previous
          step.
        </p><p>
          If your counterparty's SSL certificate was signed by a commercial certificate authority whose certificate
          already exists in the JRE's <span class="emphasis"><em>cacerts</em></span> truststore, you can omit the
          <code class="code">trustStore*</code> attributes.
        </p></div></div></div><div class="section"><div class="titlepage"><div><div><h3 class="title"><a name="optfeature_ssl_-client_auth"></a>6.6.5.&nbsp;Client Authentication</h3></div></div></div><p>
      In the above configuration scenarios, the initiating FIX session (the SSL client) was configured to trust the
      server to which it connects.  However, the accepting FIX session (the SSL server) had no restrictions
      on which clients could connect. Theoretically, any client that had the server's public key certificate would be
      able to initiate a valid SSL connection (assuming they knew the CompIDs etc).
    </p><p>
      To create a more comprehensive network of trust, <span class="emphasis"><em>client authentication</em></span> can be used. It
      provides a way for the server to identify and trust each client, thereby establishing two-way trust. The client
      is responsible for identifying itself during the connection initiation with the counterparty; the identity
      provided must match one that the server is configured to trust. The Node can be configured to
      <span class="emphasis"><em>require</em></span> client authentication when acting as an acceptor, and to <span class="emphasis"><em>provide</em></span>
      client authentication when acting as an initiator.
    </p><div class="simplesect"><div class="titlepage"><div><div><h4 class="title"><a name="d5e5163"></a>Requiring Client Authentication when Accepting SSL Connections</h4></div></div></div><p>
        To configure an acceptor FIX session to require client authentication, both a keystore and a truststore must
        be present. The keystore holds your server's private key, and the trust store holds the public key
        certificate(s) of the client(s) you wish to trust and accept.
      </p><p>
        For this example, we'll enable client authentication for the session we already configured in the
        <a href="ch06s06.html#optfeature_ssl-acceptor-config" title="6.6.4.1.&nbsp;Configuring a Session to Accept SSL Connections">previous section</a>.  We've already created our keystore;
        now we must create a truststore that contains the certificates of the clients we trust.  We'll assume the
        client has provided us with its certificate in a file called <span class="emphasis"><em>clientXYZ.cer</em></span>. To create a
        truststore and import the certificate:
      </p><pre class="programlisting">$ keytool -importcert -alias clientXYZ -file clientXYZ.cer -keystore server.truststore
Enter keystore password:  ********

Trust this certificate? [no]:  yes

        Now the session must be configured to use the truststore and to require clients to identify themselves:

         counterpartycompid="CLIENT"
         fixversion="4.2"
         keyStore="/path/to/server.keystore"
         keyStorePassword="keyStorePassword"
         keyPassword="keyPassword"
         needClientAuth="true"
         trustStore="/path/to/server.truststore"

  &lt;SessionManager&gt;
    &lt;SourceMessageProcessors/&gt;
    &lt;ListenerMessageProcessors/&gt;
  &lt;/SessionManager&gt;
&lt;/Session&gt;</pre><p>
        With this configuration in place, when a client connects they must present their certificate. If it matches
        a certificate in the truststore, the connection will commence; otherwise the connection will terminate.
      </p></div><div class="simplesect"><div class="titlepage"><div><div><h4 class="title"><a name="d5e5173"></a>Providing Client Authentication when Initiating an SSL Connection</h4></div></div></div><p>
        As the initiator, a client certificate must be provided when establishing an SSL connection. The process
        for obtaining a certificate varies depending on the security procedures in place at the counterparty.  You may
        need to generate your own, or the counterparty may provide one for you.  To create your own, you'd first
        generate a keypair, export the public key and then either sign the certificate yourself or have a commercial
        certificate authority sign it.  This can all be accomplished using the <code class="code">keytool</code> utility.
      </p><p>
        In the following example, we'll assume the counterparty has provided everything that's needed, including the
        private key, <span class="emphasis"><em>client_key.pem</em></span>, and its corresponding client certificate,
        <span class="emphasis"><em>client_cert.pem</em></span>.  We'll continue with the session we configured in the
        <a href="ch06s06.html#optfeature_ssl-initiator-config" title="6.6.4.2.&nbsp;Configuring a Session to Initiate an SSL Connection">previous section</a>, which already has a truststore
        that includes the certificate of the server.  All that's left is to create the keystore:

      The first step in troubleshooting any SSL-related issue is to enable Java SSL debugging, which provides
      details about the keys that are configured and exchanged during an SSL connection.  All of the debug logging
      is printed to stdout, not to the Catalys log file. To enable, set this system property in your startup command:
    </p><pre class="programlisting">java -Djavax.net.debug=ssl,handshake,verbose ...</pre><p>
