      The Flat File Adapter is designed to pass messages between the Node and a set of files. Messages received from
      FIX sessions are written to a file-based FIFO queue for reading by another system or application. In the other
      direction, the Flat File Adapter reads messages from a separate file-based FIFO queue and sends them out a FIX
      session.
    </p></div><div class="section"><div class="titlepage"><div><div><h3 class="title"><a name="adapter_flat_file-flatfileadapter"></a>7.10.2.&nbsp;Operation</h3></div></div></div><p>
      The Flat File Adapter uses three FIFO file persistent queues; one for messages received from FIX, one for messages
      to be sent to FIX, and one (optionally) for messages which cannot be sent to FIX. The adapter is thus
      both a queue writer (messages from FIX are written to a <code class="code">fromFixQueue</code>, messages which cannot be sent
      to FIX are optionally written to a <code class="code">toFixErrorQueue</code>) and a queue reader (messages in the
      <code class="code">toFixQueue</code> are read and sent to FIX).
    </p><p>It is the responsibility of the other party to:</p><div class="orderedlist"><ol class="orderedlist" type="1"><li class="listitem">
        Act as a queue reader of the <code class="code">fromFixQueue</code>, adhering to the rules acting as a FIFO file queue
        reader.
      </li><li class="listitem">
        Act as a queue writer to the <code class="code">toFixQueue</code>, adhering to the rules for acting as a FIFO file queue
        writer.
      </li></ol></div><p>
      Before sending a message out a session, the adapter marks the file as read in the <code class="code">toFixQueue</code>. If the
      flat file adapter suffers an outage while attempting to send the message to FIX and before the message is removed
      from the queue, the message state is retained in the queue. On recovery, the flat file adapter determines that
      the last message has already been read and explicitly sets the <code class="code">PossResend</code> flag to indicate a
      possible resend to the other party.
    </p><p>
      If the <code class="code">toFixErrorQueue</code> is enabled, messages which cannot be sent to a session are written to it.
      In this case it is the responsibility of the other party to read the <code class="code">toFixErrorQueue</code> to detect such
      errors.
    </p></div><div class="section"><div class="titlepage"><div><div><h3 class="title"><a name="adapter_flat_file-config"></a>7.10.3.&nbsp;Configuration</h3></div></div></div><p>
      The adapter is configured by adding a <code class="code">FlatFileAdapter</code> element inside both the
      <code class="code">SourceMessageProcessors</code> and <code class="code">ListenerMessageProcessors</code> elements of a session.
      The <code class="code">FlatFileAdapter</code> element must be present in both the source and message listener chain, and
      both configuration instances point to the same runtime element. This is configured by having a
      <code class="code">MessageProcessorReference</code> in one of the message processing chains referring to the other.
    </p><p>
      For a complete list of attributes, see the
      <a href="config_reference.html#config_ref_FlatFileAdapter" title="FlatFileAdapter">FlatFileAdapter Configuration Reference</a>.
    </p><p>
      The following example shows a <code class="code">FlatFileAdapter</code> element configured on one session with the minimum
      attributes configured:
    </p><pre class="programlisting">&lt;Sessions&gt;

&lt;/Sessions&gt;</pre></div><div class="section"><div class="titlepage"><div><div><h3 class="title"><a name="adapter_flat_file-fifofilequeue"></a>7.10.4.&nbsp;File System Persistent Message Queue</h3></div></div></div><div class="simplesect"><div class="titlepage"><div><div><h4 class="title"><a name="d5e8137"></a>Specification</h4></div></div></div><p>
        The file system persistent message queue supports FIFO semantics via the naming of message files. That is, each
        new message is placed in a separate file and given a name which represents its relative position in the queue.
        Thus the name of each message file contains a queue sequence number. Note that the queue sequence number may not
        always correspond with the FIX sequence number of the contained message.
      </p></div><div class="simplesect"><div class="titlepage"><div><div><h4 class="title"><a name="adapter_flat_file-fifofilequeuewriter"></a>Rules For Acting As a FIFO File Queue Writer</h4></div></div></div><p>
        Queue writers must guarantee that the next message written has a queue sequence number greater than any
        existing message files. Queue readers must guarantee to read the message file with the lowest queue sequence
        number.
      </p><p>
        In order to safely survive process and/or host outages queue writers must also guarantee that all messages on
        the queue are not corrupted during the write phase. A two-phase write is used to achieve this:
      </p><div class="orderedlist"><ol class="orderedlist" type="1"><li class="listitem"><span class="bold"><strong>Write Phase</strong></span> - when a new message is to be written, the queue writer chooses
          a message file name according to the above rule and writes the message to a temporary file.
        </li><li class="listitem"><span class="bold"><strong>Commit Phase</strong></span> - when the entire message is written to the temporary file, the
          writer closes the temporary file and renames it indicating that it is now on the queue.
        </li></ol></div><p>
        If there is an outage during the write phase, then the message is never placed on the queue. The rename
        performed in the commit phase is atomic with respect to the file system and therefore is a message file makes
        it to the message queue it is guaranteed not to be corrupt.
      </p><p>
        Note that on some platforms, a queue reader may be able to see that a message file is on the queue but not
        (yet) be able to read it. This can occur if the readers attempts to open the file during the commit phase. In
        this case the reader should try again after a suitable delay.
      </p></div><div class="simplesect"><div class="titlepage"><div><div><h4 class="title"><a name="adapter_flat_file-fifofilequeuereader"></a>Rules For Acting As a FIFO File Queue Reader</h4></div></div></div><p>Queue readers must guarantee to:</p><div class="orderedlist"><ol class="orderedlist" type="1"><li class="listitem">Ignore temporary message files (since they are not yet on the queue)</li><li class="listitem">Read the message file with the lowest queue sequence number</li></ol></div><p>
        Note that step 2 above implies that the reader <span class="bold"><strong>must not</strong></span> maintain any state
        with respect to the state of the queue since:
      </p><div class="itemizedlist"><ul class="itemizedlist" type="disc"><li class="listitem">
          Queue writers are responsible for the naming of queue files and therefore the allocation of queue file
          sequence numbers.
        </li><li class="listitem">
          A queue write may suffer an outage and subsequently recover while the queue is empty and the reader is
          waiting for the next message. In this case the queue writer loses all information about the state of the
          queue and on the next write will choose the lowest available sequence number. That is, the queue sequence
          number is effectively reset.
        </li></ul></div><p>
        Queue readers must handle this sequence of events by always choosing the next message with the lowest available
        sequence number regardless of the sequence number of the most recently read message.
      </p><p>
        When a queue reader has processed a message file it must remove the message file from the queue. This is
        achieved by renaming the file to indicate that the file is no longer on the queue. Note that message files
        <span class="bold"><strong>must not</strong></span> be removed from the queue until processing is complete.
      </p><p>
        Queue readers may optionally mark message files as read after reading, but before removal. This can aid a
        reader's recovery processing after an outage in case there is a restriction on duplicate message processing.
        The flat file adapter uses this mechanism to set the <code class="code">PossResend</code> flag if it detects the
        possibility of sending a message more then once.
      </p></div></div><div class="section"><div class="titlepage"><div><div><h3 class="title"><a name="adapter_flat_file-fifofilequeueconv"></a>7.10.5.&nbsp;File Naming Conventions</h3></div></div></div><p>
      Each individual FIFO file queue exists in its own dedicated directory. Communication between parties via a single
      queue may occur in one direction only. That is, no party should be both a reader and a writer of the same queue.
    </p><p>
      Each message in the queue is contained in a separate file in the queue directory and is distinguished by its name.
      The name of each contains two pieces of information about the file:
    </p><div class="itemizedlist"><ul class="itemizedlist" type="disc"><li class="listitem">Its state</li><li class="listitem">Its relative position in the queue.</li></ul></div><p>The state of the message is encoded via a single character prefix according to the following table:</p><div class="informaltable"><table border="1"><colgroup><col><col></colgroup><thead><tr><th>File Name Prefix</th><th>File State</th></tr></thead><tbody><tr><td>T</td><td>
              Temporary file in the process of being written and is not yet in the queue. The queue writer creates
              and writes to this file.
            </td></tr><tr><td>Q</td><td>
              The file is in the queue and is available for reading. The queue writer creates this file by renaming a
              temporary file.
            </td></tr><tr><td>R</td><td>
              The file is in the queue but has been read by the queue reader. This is an optional state and is
              controlled by the queue reader, however, the queue writer must regard this as valid queue file. There
              should be at most one file with this prefix in the queue at any time.
            </td></tr></tbody></table></div><p>
      A file's relative position in the queue is specified by its sequence number suffix. The lower the sequence number,
      the closer to the head of the queue. The higher the sequence number, the closer to the tail of the queue. The
      queue writer determines the sequence number of the next file it writes.

              situation by always reading the message file with the lowest sequence number, regardless of the sequence
